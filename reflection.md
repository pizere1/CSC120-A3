Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
  1. Melissa
  2. Swikiriti
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
   I have not been able to attend TA hours regarding this A3 Chatbot assignment but I plan to attend some sessions for questions I have             accumulated in these past days working on the assignment.
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
  1. While Python is a good language, I find Java more interesting and engaging compared to python
  2. I am convinced that Java will give me many challenging moments which i hope will result in late, but sure "Ah.." moments
  3. I find Java easier to interpret and modify compared to python.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
  1. As Pyhton is interpreted, it can give one false hopes that everything is in place until things go down midway while the java compilation 
    allows the(though mostly annoying) minimization of errors before it starts to run
  2. Because python is a more flexible in terms of writing, it can be hard for someone with a fore introduction to strict langauges to get 
   acustomed and evasive of errors, due to the trained reverance of general programming rules which Java follows.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  1. Save big amount of time for these programming assignments, they are usually more challenging in tricky ways than the proffesor's 
  explanations make them sound.
  2. Consulting colleagues and ask for help before the last minute, it doesn't work well when approached otherwise.
